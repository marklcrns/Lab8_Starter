3) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging
application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature
allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

4) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of
a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max
message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
